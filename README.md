# Citi Bike Analytics - Tableau

## Aim

The aim of this project is to create visualisations and dashboards on Citi Bike trip history data to look for trends that can give insights for improving the program.


## Data source

Jersey City bike data from January 2019 to December 2020 is used for this analysis.
Data is downloaded from https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data


## Method

- Download data in csv format
- Use Pandas to combine and transform the data
- Load the data to Tableau


## Findings

- Covid-19 resulted in reduction of total number of rides by about 17% in 2020 compared to 2019
- Proportion of rides taken by subscribers dropped significantly in 2020 to less than 70% from  almost 90% in 2019.  Most likely caused by Covid-19
- The number of male riders is significantly higher than female. Male riders account for more than 65% of total trips taken in 2019 and 2020
- Male riders take more trip in all age group whereas female riders take longer trip in almost all age group
- Summer months have the highest total rides while winter months the lowest
- Increasing number of bikes being available and reduction in trips result in improvement in bike availability / reduction in utilisation rate


## Recommendation 

- Conduct marketing campaigns aiming to bring back the lost subscribers; and to appeal to new potential subscribers in particular female residents
